# RDR2-Personal-Dog
A cowboy without a horse is not a cowboy. But if you ever wondered how it'd be to play RDR2 with a personal dog, this mod is for you.

### Installation:
- Download and install AB's ScripthookRDR2: http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/
- Make sure you have an asi loader, it usually comes along with Scripthook.
- Copy *DogCompanion.asi* and the *DogCompanion* folder to the game's root folder.

### How to use:
- Fnd a dog that you like and pat it.
- While patting it, you'll notice a new "Bond" prompt. Activate it and the dog will join you.

### Key features:
- Your dog will follow you and can be told to sit down and wait. If you enter an interior, it will wait for you outside.
- Your dog will help you hunt in various ways: after you hunt an animal, your dog will run towards its location and start barking, helping you to find it (unless it was told to stay).
- When tracking an animal, your dog will use it's senses and help find it quickly.
- Your dog will get agitated by nearby predators and attack them if they're too close.
- The mod adds a dedicated new core for your dogs health.
- In order to recover your dog's health, it needs to be fed with hunted prey.
- The mod provides full ingame tutorials and hints.
- You may give your dog a name and change it anytime ingame.
- You may dismiss your dog at anytime.

### Known issues:
- Dogs original color is not saved, and a default color is used.  This is because there is no way (that I know about) to retrieve a peds outfit index. If you know anything about it, let me know.
- The dogs core is misplaced when using Expanded radar mode.
